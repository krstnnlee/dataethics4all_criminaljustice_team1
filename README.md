# The Problem

Black Americans are incarcerated at six times the rate of White Americans and face longer sentences for similar crimes (Carson, 2014; Rehavi and Starr, 2014)

How can we shine light on the presence of bias in the US criminal justice system and compare it to other countries?


We begin by looking at the number of Americans arrested by race. Due to an imbalance in our data, we log our black and white race variables to get a more accurate depiction on the disparity of arrests made by race.

Next, we create a breakout of crimes commited by race in the United States.

*Arrests of Native American People by Crime: US*


We compare our findings to data on convictions and prosecutions of people in England and Wales. There, we see a disparity between the comparions of arrests across race and total arrests overall.

*Comparison of Arrests in US versus UK

*Percentage of Convictions by Race*


As we can see from our analysis, the rates of conviction are similar across race in England and Wales. When we break out the data to look at raw numbers of people prosecuted in the UK, we see that prosecutions are more in comparible with the distribution of race.

## Purpose 

- Comparative Law and Legal Transplants 

    - Which laws make it possible to reduce bias in the criminal justice system?
    
- By following the tenants of comparative law, we can implement solutions of international democratic criminal justice systems for the purpose of formulating policies that reduce racial bias.

- We can hold politicians and international organizations by creating a tool that helps detect racial bias through the creation and upkeep of readily accessible open source data available to the public.

- Our solution seeks to not only shine a light on bias but to also encourage more equitable policing by facilitating the work of comparative lawyers and promoting that an independent branch of knowledge that serves as a check and balance against possible abuses of the system.


## Impact

- Transparency in Data leads to a more rigorous comparative legal branch in the US.

- It will lead to a deeper analysis of what is “effective” policy:

    - Eg. If mandatory bias training is required, but the data shows that bias is still present, why? Bias training inadequate?
    
    - Eg. if your policies are similar within different countries, but the effects are different: why? Where else is bias creeping in?
    
- Can eventually build out to a ML model that can use predictive analysis to can mitigate future instances of biases in a given criminal justice system.

- This can be used in conjunction with other tools designed by International Organizations such as the UN for comparable governments around the world to hold criminal justice systems accountable that perpetuate racial bias in policing.

## Factors to Consider

- Due to constraints in data, we focused on arrest statistics, which is arguably not representative of how many people are actually convicted.

- Non-uniform ways across states and municipalities to record multiple factors relating to each arrest
    - Such as Sex, Age, Religion, Income
    
- Socioeconomic factors may be implicit within the data reports themselves
    - Bias in society → Bias in reports
    
- International approach may not be accessible due to foreign privacy laws
